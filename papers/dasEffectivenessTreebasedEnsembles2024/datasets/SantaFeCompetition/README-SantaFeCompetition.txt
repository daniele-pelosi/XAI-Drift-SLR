Santa FÃ© Time Series Competition: Dataset A

% Data Set A: Laser generated data Data generated by a far-infrared laser in a chaotic state. The data was contributed by Udo Huebner, Phys.-Techn. Bundesanstalt, Braunschweig, Germany, and were collected primarily by N. B. Abraham and C. O. Weiss. These data were recorded from a Far-Infrared-Laser in a chaotic state; here is the description from Dr. Huebner: The measurements were made on an 81.5-micron 14NH3 cw (FIR) laser, pumped optically by the P(13) line of an N2O laser via the vibrational aQ(8,7) NH3 transition. The basic laser setup can be found in Ref. 1. The intensity data was recorded by a LeCroy
oscilloscope. No further processing happened. The experimental signal to noise ratio was about 300 which means slightly under the half bit uncertainty of the analog to digital conversion. The data is a cross-cut through periodic to chaotic intensity pulsations of the laser. Chaotic pulsations more or less follow the theoretical Lorenz model (see References) of a two level system.
